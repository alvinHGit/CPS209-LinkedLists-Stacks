# CPS209-LinkedLists-Stacks
A graphical Java program done in my first year in Computer Science. We had to implement recursion, inheritance, frames, GUI, listeners
and our own implementation of linkedlist and stack classes in Java. As well, we had to graphically show the linkedlists by
drawing a train and allowing the user to graphically drag and link each railcart onto the train. We had to graphically show stacks
by stacking drawn boxes together and adding the option to "push" and "pop" each box on the stack onto the railcarts.
#MainViewer.java
Contains the main method.
#NOTE
The program was compiled with javac.
